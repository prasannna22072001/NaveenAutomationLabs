#selenium automation with java
i am using page object model in this repo and testng framework.
i used strems in java for looping. so these strems are very usful for for loop and if else loop. 
used testng reports for test cases.
wrote a code to take screenshot (where ever the test failed it takes screenshot).
used faker repo from maven repository. This faker repo is a kind of repo where we can access different types of data
